# nofrontend

A tiny theme for sites with no frontend.

Note: this site does not prevent access to the REST API, so content will be exposed there if you do not prevent anonymous access to the REST API.

## Usage

Install & activate.

By default, all requests to the frontend are redirected to the site's admin URL but you can filter this with `nofrontend.redirect_url`.
